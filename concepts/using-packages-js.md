# Using Packages in Code

## Introduction
This guide will teach you how to use packages in your code, focusing on key concepts like `require`, `import`, `export`, and managing `package.json`.

## `require` Keyword (CommonJS)
- **What It Is**: Like asking your friend to lend you a book. You're getting a module (a set of functions or objects) to use in your code.
- **Syntax**: `const moduleName = require('module-name');`

### Example of `require`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```
Here, we're getting the Express.js package, like borrowing a cookbook to make a web server.

## `import` Keyword (ES6 Modules)
- **What It Is**: Like bookmarking pages in a textbook. You're picking specific things to use from a module.
- **Syntax**: `import moduleName from 'module-name';`
- **Note**: Add `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` when using ES6 modules in Node.js.

### Example of `import`:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```
In this example, we're picking specific parts (React and ReactDOM) from their packages.

## Managing `package.json`
- **What It Is**: It's like a shopping list for your code. It tells Node.js what packages your project needs.
- **Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1"
  }
}
```

## `module.exports` and `export`
- **`module.exports` (CommonJS)**: Like writing a guidebook. You're sharing parts of your code for others to use.
- **`export` (ES6)**: Like showing your homework solution. You're making parts of your code available for others.

### Example of `module.exports` and `export`:
```javascript
// In Node.js using module.exports
module.exports = {
  myFunction: function() {
    // Function code
  }
};

// In ES6 using export
export const myFunction = () => {
  // Function code
};
```

## Conclusion
Understanding `require`, `import`, `export`, and how to manage `package.json` is like knowing how to borrow, pick, share, and list books in a library. It's crucial for using packages and modules in your projects.
