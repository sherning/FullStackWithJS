# Node Package Manager

## Understanding NPM
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, providing a repo of JS packages. It helps in managing third-party packages and their versions in your Node.js projects.

## Managing Project Dependencies
Dependencies are external packages that your project needs to function correctly. These are listed in a `package.json` file in your project directory.

## Using `package.json` File
This file contains metadata about your project, including dependencies. It's created by running `npm init` in your project directory and answering a series of prompts.

### Example of `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "my-node-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Installing Packages
Command: `npm install <package-name>`
Example: To install Express.js, a popular web framework, you would run:
```bash
npm install express
```
This command updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and installs the package in the `node_modules` directory.

## Updating Packages
Command: `npm update <package-name>`
Example: To update Express.js, you would run:
```bash
npm update express
```
This command updates the package to the latest version according to the version rules in `package.json`.

## Removing Packages
Command: `npm uninstall <package-name>`
Example: To remove Express.js, you would run:
```bash
npm uninstall express
```
This command removes the package from `node_modules` and updates `package.json`.

## Understanding `npm install`, `npm update`, and `npm uninstall` Commands
- **npm install**: Installs all dependencies from `package.json`, or a specific package if a name is provided.
- **npm update**: Updates packages to their latest versions based on versioning rules in `package.json`.
- **npm uninstall**: Removes a package from your project and updates `package.json`.

## Additional Notes
- **Versioning**: Pay attention to version numbers and the use of symbols like `^` and `~`, which dictate how versions are updated.
- **package-lock.json**: This file is automatically generated and ensures that the same versions of each package will be installed on different setups.
