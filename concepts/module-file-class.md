# Module vs File vs Class in JavaScript

| Concept | Module                                  | File                                     | Class                                     |

| What It Is | Like a chapter in a textbook, contains a specific part of the code (functions, classes) related to a topic. | Like a page in a notebook, where you write your JavaScript code. Usually ends with `.js`. | Like a blueprint for a house, describes an object's structure and behavior. |
| Usage   | Used to keep code organized and reusable. Can be imported into another file. | Basic containers for code. Can include modules, classes, or any JavaScript code. | Used to define objects. Objects have properties and methods as defined in the class. |
| Example | A file `mathModule.js` with functions for math operations. | Any `.js` file like `script.js`. | A class `Car` describing properties (color) and methods (drive). |
| Key Differences | Organize and group code, can be shared between files. | Basic containers for code, can include various code types. | Blueprints for objects, define properties and methods. |
