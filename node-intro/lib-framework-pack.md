| Aspect              | Library                                                                                                         | Framework                                                                                                                          | Package                                                                                                                                       |

| **Definition**      | A collection of reusable code that provides specific functionality or features.                                 | A structure providing the foundation for developing software applications, often including libraries.                              | A bundled piece of software or code, which can be a library, a framework, or any other type of reusable code.                                 |
| **Characteristics** | Focuses on specific tasks or features. Developers call functions as needed. Does not dictate program structure. | Provides a predefined structure and dictates application architecture. Developers fill in predefined "gaps". Inversion of Control. | Contains libraries, frameworks, or utilities. Designed for easy installation and dependency management. Distributed through package managers. |
| **Example**         | jQuery - simplifies HTML document manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.                                | Angular - a TypeScript-based framework for building web applications.                                                              | lodash - provides utility functions for common programming tasks in JavaScript.                                                               |
| **Control**         | Developers have control and use the library functions when necessary.                                           | Frameworks have more control over the flow of an application [Inversion of Control](inversion-of-control.md).                      | Dependent on its content; could be a library, framework, or other utilities.                                                                  |
| **Scope**           | More specific in scope, focusing on particular functionalities.                                                 | Broader in scope, offering a comprehensive structure for application development.                                                  | General term, can encompass a library, a framework, or other code modules.                                                                    |
