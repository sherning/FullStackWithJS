# Understanding CSS Selectors: With Space vs. Without Space

CSS selectors are crucial for targeting elements in HTML documents. The presence or absence of a space in a selector can significantly change its meaning. Here, we explore the difference between selectors with a space (`descendant`) and without a space (`direct relationship`).

## Selectors with Space: `descendant`

### `li .class`

This selector targets elements with the class `.class` that are descendants of an `<li>` element.

**Example HTML**:
```html
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            <span class="class">Selected - Descendant of li</span>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="class">Selected - Descendant of li</p>
    </li>
</ul>
```

**Use Case**: To select elements with a specific class within a particular parent element, regardless of their direct nesting level.

## Selectors Without Space: `direct relationship`

### `li.class`

This selector targets `<li>` elements that have the class `.class`.

**Example HTML**:
```html
<ul>
    <li class="class">Selected - li with class</li>
    <li>
        <div class="class">Not Selected</div>
    </li>
</ul>
```

**Use Case**: To select elements that are a specific tag and have a specific class directly applied to them.

## Conclusion

Understanding the use of spaces in CSS selectors is essential for precise element targeting. Spaces indicate descendant relationships, while the absence of space denotes a direct relationship between the tag and the class.
